## 📝 Project Overview

In 2017, I developed this JavaFX-based accounting platform to manage financial data and perform various accounting functions. The application integrates user authentication and provides advanced financial features, including loan amortization calculations. The goal was to create a user-friendly and functional application for personal or small business finances.

## 🛠️ Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration system.
- **Dashboard:** Overview of financial status with easy access to key features.
- **Transaction Management:** Track and categorize transactions.
- **Loan Amortization:** Calculate and visualize loan amortization schedules.
- **Reports:** Generate financial reports and summaries.
- **Expense Tracking:** Monitor and categorize expenses.
- **Budgeting Tools:** Set and manage budgets.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **JavaFX:** Framework for building the desktop application.
- **JFoenix:** Material design components for a modern UI.
- **SceneBuilder:** Tool for designing and building the user interface.
- **SQLite/MySQL:** Database management system for storing financial data.
- **Java:** Programming language used for the application logic.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The application follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture:

- **Model:** Manages data and business logic, including financial calculations and database interactions.
- **View:** Built with JavaFX and SceneBuilder, featuring a modern UI with JFoenix components.
- **Controller:** Handles user interactions, updates the model, and refreshes the view.

### Key Components

- **Authentication Module:** Manages user login, registration, and session.
- **Transaction Module:** Handles transactions, categories, and reporting.
- **Loan Amortization Module:** Computes and displays loan amortization schedules.

## 🚀 Usage

- **Login/Register:** Use the authentication module to access the application.
- **Dashboard:** View financial summaries and navigate to different features.
- **Manage Transactions:** Add, edit, and categorize transactions.
- **Loan Amortization:** Input loan details to see amortization schedules.
- **Generate Reports:** Create and download financial reports.

## 🚧 Future Improvements

- **Advanced Analytics:** Add more sophisticated financial analysis tools.
- **Cloud Integration:** Integrate cloud-based data storage and synchronization.
- **Enhanced Security:** Implement additional security measures.
- **User Customization:** Allow users to personalize the dashboard and reports.
